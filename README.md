1. Introduction:
The project presents the growth of production, raw materials and
the productivity of the agricultural sector in India through different periods. The statistics that can be used in it, are extracted from the Indian government platform "OGD" in CSV format. These data are used as a starting point for the analysis of India's development in agriculture as well as the surrounding sectors.

2. Data structure
Crops - cereals, legumes, oilseeds, sugars, fiber, horticultural crops, non-horticultural crops, animals, forestry, manure, fertilizers and pesticides, and others.
Categories - Value of production, Value of intermediate raw materials, Gross value added and others.
The other columns include the different periods in India: the Great Revolution (1951 to 1968), the Green Revolution (1968-1981), the Broad Revolution (1982-1991), the Early Liberalization (1991-1998), the Ninth Plan (1998-2002), the Tenth Plan (2002-2006) and the Eleventh Plan (2007-2012). Each of the columns contains values that show the percentage increase / decrease compared to the previous period, for a certain crop and category.

3. Purpose
The aim of the project is to test different components of the database, visualizing linear projections, testing results derived from models such as Random forest, native bayes, neutral network, tree, cn2 rule industrion, knn.
